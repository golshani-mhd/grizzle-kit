- Grizzle-Kit enhances work with huandu/go-sqlbuilder by adding type safety features. Its primary goal is to eliminate string-based column and table references through auto-generated typed variable names.
- This library includes a flavor mechanism to support different databases, ensuring your code remains compatible across various database systems.
- Grizzle-Kit draws inspiration from Drizzle-Kit in Node.js, so you should follow its guidelines and naming conventions as closely as possible.
- Do not write tests until explicitly instructed to do so.
- The README should be kept up-to-date, complete, and minimal.
